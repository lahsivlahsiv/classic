<b style="color:red">Why JP Morgan</b> <br>

JP Morgan is definiteily a big name in banking industry. But I do know a few people who have worked for the bank and have nice things to say.
The culture is inclusive and relaxed. The work life balance is something the company prouds there self on because they truly believe in it and it shows.
One of them who joined as a contractor, became permanent and moved to India.

	<b style="color:red"> About me  </b> <br>

I have done my masters in mathematics and computer applications , a   5 yr integrated course from IIT in India.
Started my career working in telecoms / networking ...worked on snmp..(simple network management)...Worked in C/C++ and even in assembly language
. So I have not mentioned those on my CV as I guess they are not relevant to job at hand . From C++ I moved  to world of dynamic langauges like perl and python . I have dabbled in all aspects of software development be it application level, system level programming or web programming. 

I have worked for UBS where I developed the inframon program which was a multiprocessing utility/daemon to do sanity checks on the environment
I also worked on modperl and was part of 2 -factor authentication program that provided certificated based authentication
At DB I worked on DAP which was basically a Tomcat/JBoss/ application deployment platform
At Morgan stanley I have been working on snapshot database project and also development of backupframework.

As far as different domains I worked on..

1) In india worked in snmp and just made a brush with SS7 technology.
2) At UBS worked in SSo technology
3) At virgin, worked on set top boxes..


There has been sort of cost cutting going on in Morgan Stanley since December and I guess it is the consultants who are bearing the brunt.

<p id="weakness">
<b style="color:red">My Weaknesses</b> <br>
Weaknesses:
   I tend to do more that is required even for my own good....Simply put..I am seeing a piece of code..I see my code snippet which I do not understand completely..Ok i can extract the code snippet treat it as black box and learn separetely what the code snippet is doing...I know what it does...but then what i do..

    1) I note it down and then I try to figure out..how it does it...Sometimes, the fact that I do not know how it does it ...keeps nagging me...I will try to multitask more than that is required sometimes..

    2) I cannot do too much of "unplanned work" .If at all I am doing some work on ad-hoc basis , it should be balanced with some planned work....Because , when I saw planned work..I mean I am given some work to do in X number of days..My aim would be to do it in X-1 day..because I would also want to have some  buffer...and other time..I need to reflect on what I did...kind of learn...or may be enhance my understanding of the area I worked on in a relaxed manner...For me it is like proper closure to a work-item...

    3) Some work items have lot of dependencies, and your work gets delayed because of certain issues with dependent systems down....And if my task gets delayed...I feel little uneasy..even though it is not my fault..

My analysis. When you have thirdparty code to look at , a large code base to look at to trouble shoot an issue.It is sometimes easy to get bogged down by the sheer enormity.One must be able to separate wheat from the chaff..separate what is relevant from what is irrelevant...very subjective thing..you cannot quantify.....

     Analysis:
       That is what has stood me in good stead.
       Login Server project - Understood the project - did POC - it was my inputs that made the design possible- openssl-certificates

     Desire to learn and not dettered by challenges.:
        I like to learn what I do not know...and try to retain it if I think it will be usefull addition to knowledge database...Case in point ..Virgin media ( challenging work )

     My code would rarely fail in the live/uat env..because I understand what I code..I make sure I cover all the corner cases...in present env..no uat access..not even r/o....i cannot even see the logs..so very important that it works the first time..

     In case of issue:
        Being helpful and not afraid to seek help..You must try to do as much as you can do about an issue..that is not give up too early..but at the same time have the foresight/vision to realize that working too much on my own might not be too useful or fruitful as opposed to takign some help...you should not shy away

<b style="color:red">A Challenge</b> <br>
Virgin Media role was quite challenging...
Embedded piece of code...people freely use global variables...it is easy for two functions to pass info via global variable...rather than thru function parameter...

You are workign on settop boxes..you do not have any ide ..all you have is "shell env.." where you can see your debug outputs...in case you want to confirm something...it takes quite a while...you need to boot up the settop box..which takes 10 minutes..So you need to educate yourself a lot about the code, make some informed guesses...before you boot up next time as it can easily eat up your entire time..booting and rebooting...

Case in point:
  1) It is a live issue on virgin set top boxes...2 subsytems..VOD ( video on demand ) and PVR ( Recording system )..These are big systems , each with 50-60 files.. The issue..have some recordings on ..is that when you go to video on demand,drill in further..and press tv...you get barker channel..not the channel you last tuned to...So entire process takes pressing some 10 keys..

This issue was intermittent issue..This issue had been tried by developers who had been with virgin media for 5/6 years..The final comment was...we can have a workaround..so that issue does not happen...No one had clue why this issue ocurred...Then I  found that it was due to global variable set in PVR env...that had a side effect in the VOD env...It is very difficult to describe how I approached the issue..but yes..Analysing is mental process..very difficult to quanity....



Initially , try to get as many facts as I can get while reverse engineering the process..I jot it down ..kind of functional analysis..and then once I narrow it down to few functions..I drill down further...

Very friendly...I can tell of a guy who was so aloof to the point that some people found him very rude..But he was on good speaking terms with me..because

I do not judge people...I felt it was just a shell...When you have to get along with people..there is no need to impose your views..or contradict their views..you can listen to them without being very reactive...As long as that part does not hurt..you might call it diplomatic..but i find it very natural...there does not have to "REASON" for everything...people have thier views..

it is consultancy firm by my ex-colleague. He is in the midst of securing "gambling license". He hired me to write some compliance software. For eg, I was wrote few utilities to catch any susceptible fraud. For eg. if a guy loses a lot to someone it could be a case of money laundering via game. 

Also, he was attempting to move his catalyst based application to python based Django. Basically he is a perl programmer and so used the perl based web framework , so I did take a stab at porting trying to port it to Flask but then he ran out of cash and we abandoned it.

I was hired  by the IT infrastructure team called distribute compute,  for the storage team to help them with the project called "Tertiary Backup Project". Essentially the project entalied using NetBackup API using python and feed into splunk. Interestingly that project did not take off as they lost interest in the API, reason being that the api would give paged output, returning 100 records at a time. For records running into hundreds of thousands, it would take almost half an hour. Even though I drastically improved by making the access multithreaded (reducting total time from 30 mts to 5 mts), but it was not good enough. 

I  worked on RPA which is acronym for root privileged access. 

The reason for RPA that the application teams who were using some kind of automated application release process needed the ability to do privileged actions like starting/stopping a service, creating user under /opt without giving them the "root" access and also doing some validations along the way via black and whitelists.

I wrote enhancements for the project like...reading the syslog files and also the files that have been gzipped. I wrote the modules to do the validation. For eg. there was an IAM files that contained the users and groups that could be provisioned.I automated the process of writing to the 

Also, to comply with software auditory requriements , I also wrote a testsuite. The testsuite that would be triggered as soon as pull request would be made to ensure changes did not break the existing code.

<p id="backup">
<b style="color:red"> backup project</b> <br>
Essentially we had been hired to implement snapshot backup. Snapshots are different from traditional backups in that they take incremental backups at the hardware/storage level and such are fast or should i say very fast and it happens it matter of seconds. We had to configure the cgroups ( which are basically idenitifer to the diskgroups ) and then call the APIs exposed by the storage team that would take the snapshots.

For eg if certain database was supposed to snap-shotted, we would find the diskgroups associated with database server on which the database sat, configure the cgroups for the database server. Additionally infrastructure scripts were modified so that storage allocated to database servers was segregated, in that database servers diskgroups did not overlap with each other as database restore for one would adversly affect the other.

We were tasked to write a  product agnostic framework that can be used to do automate backups replacing their adhoc-methods and cron jobs for  taking backups.
Basically the ask was to have a  layer of abstraction whereby you can tie database backups in a group called backupgroup and run backup on the group. Each backup group had a time window in which it was supposed to run within. For eg, we would have a daily backup group where in all databases that needed to be backup would be made part of and a day time-window would be put in. It was an object oriented framework with classes for various backup methods like snapshot and classes for various products like sybase/oracle and a Scheduler class , a backup group class etc. The framework would raise alerts if certain backups failed

<p id="testsuite">
<b style="color:red"> Testsuite</b> <br>
Another major project we did was the development of a testsuite. The motivation for it came from the need to be able to confidently deploy/productionize a new version of sybase (which is kind of yearly) without breaking the production environment. Since they did not have any proper testuite, the usual procedure was to deploy new version in UAT for a month or so and then deploy the new version in good faith. I guess they realised that they need to have some test criteria and perhaps it was an auditory requirement as well.

DBAU Testsuite is a developer tool to automate the testing of unix based command line programs based on 2 paradigms:

1) Compare the diff (using diff3 ) against other known acceptable outputs  
2) Verifying the output of the command based on patterns you expect to find or not find in the output



The testsuite can compare the results of running 2 commands, typically prod version of the script and new version of the script to check that no unintended changes or behaviour has been introduced. The idea it to reduce the need to write specific test criteria and automate comparison based on results available for every command namely stdout/stderr/exitcode.
<br><br>
Test suite runs scripts configured in the configuration files and captures the output or what we call caches the output. The facility to cache the output comes very handy for not only allowing to view the results for offline viewing but also obviating the need to run the command if results are already cached. You can run the analysers like comparator and Verifier on anytime on the cached results.
<br><br>
The analysis provided by testsuite is based on comparison of output as provided by software component we call "Comparator" and verification of output provided by component called "Verifier".
<br><br>
   Verifier looks for patterns which we expect to find or not find in the output files
   <br><br>
   Comparator compares 2 references outputs against target output, idea being to ignore irrelevant differences and only compare relevant differences. Comparator is built around diff3 utility with easy-only commondline option. diff3 takes 3 files as input say fileA , fileB and fileC

DAP is a deployment platform for jboss/tomcat applications.
<br><br>
 It hosts about 350 Deutsche bank internal applications. 
 <br><br>It provides clients an interface/portal  to deploy their applications and run various control actions like start/stop/threaddump on them. 
 <br><br>The platform provides the automation for running such control actions I worked on adding various enhancements to the platform like integration with loglogic and controlM etc.
 <br><br>
 
The code was legacy webframework that used cgi::prototype as web framework. cgi::prototype is basically the controller ( in the MVC design pattern ).
<br><br>
Gives you lots of hooks in the webpage workflow.
<br><br>

We usually have an application class derived from cgi::prototype and call the method activate on it.
<br><br>
The default implementation of the class that can be overridden is to call 3 methods on it.
<br><br>
dispatch method, the responder method and the renderer method
<br><br>

The dispatch method looks at the state/url ( typically to identify the state ) and selects appropriate controller object. For eg, control actions url ( would have control ) in the url, the id of the app etc, and the operation.
The controller object would apply application logic and call responder ( default implementation returns the same object ).

CMC:
digitallook is a financial data and news provider, where financial data is got from various sources like exchanges, moneymate (for funds ) and factset.
It also provides realtime data ( although it is 15 mts late ). The realtime data is retrieved from java systems that connect to exchanges.
The company also hosts financial sites for certain clients like yahoo, halifax etc, uk.finance.yahoo.com is hosted by dl.
The entire code base is in perl.

My work is mainly related to the tools used by the content team to upload finacial data. For eg, company fundamentals data(like dividends ,interim and final, profits etc) is something that is uploaded in the database using excel sheet.
There is a tool that parses the excel sheet for the data, processes it ( like applying corporate action etc ) on it and storing the data in database.
<br>
Shares in issue tool, company trades tool ( some of the tools are based on perl-cgi ) , partner admin tool ( what kinds of options are available to various partners)...
Additionally I work on back-end processses that collect data.For eg we receive daily feeds from moneymate , the feeds are in XML, that are processed and the data uploaded.
I look at issues related to feed.

And then there are bug fixes to be done.
For eg..a particular fund is not pricing..(is it because we did not receive it in the feed)..

<p id="loginserver">
<b style="color:red">LoginServer</b> <br>
I was in the IDM team ( identity management ) team working in single-sign on technology. Single sign-on (SSO) is a method of access control that enables a user to log in once and gain access to the resources without the need to reauthenticate.

 <br>

 

Let us say we have two resources/application A and B..
<br>
 

 

I was in authentication/authorisation subteam .......
<br>
 

Let me explain how the solution works and what was my role...

 <br>

This was a service we were providing to application teams..(application could be hosted on apache/IIS )   (apache / IIS )

 <br>

 

step 1 )

 <br>

Runtime: Apache/IIS plugin that intercepts the http request.
<br>
              Checks if the request has authsso-cookie  ( we used to call our request authsso )
<br>
              If not => redirects the user to login server...and the destination url is sent as query of query string like

 <br>

              clientlogin.ibb.ubs.com/login?_URI=b64 encoded destination url

 <br>

 

 

Login Server: Serves the login page
<br>
                    Authenticates
<br>
                    Serves ( disclaimer/extranet ) agreement
<br>
                    cuts the authsso cookie
<br>
                    Redirects the user to the application
<br>
 

 

Runtime:
<br>
                   User has cookies.
<br>
                   Checks if user is authorised to access the application
<br>
                   populates the headers which are used by application teams
<br>
 

 

A very simplistic view of th application...There were lot of features..like remember me , confidntail
<br>
 

 

Enhancement:

         There were certain users based in singapore who wanted to stronger authentication...And for those client certificate authentication was made....Project was called MAS.
<br>
         Furthermore there was change in design of the login server....

<br> 

        Disclaimer and extranet could be considered post login tasks......
<br>
 

 

 

My role was to make the enhancement for the login server...
<br>
 

Challenges:
<br>
  1) There was not much understanding about how client authentication works in Apache..
<br><br>
      I did POC...openssl.......seeing how certificate revocation happens...what i found out..that if client does not have certificate..we have very unfriendly message "page not found".....connection breaks at ssl level..

 <br><br>

    you can see my query on mod_ssl...Some person had written ...extension module for mod_ssl ..but it required bank approval..Moreover it would not come as part of apache standard distribution..

 <br><br>

 

    so we had to workaround using hidden frame...
<br><br>
      certificate authenticaion in hidden frame.
<br><br>
      in top level 15 sec timeout ...

 <br><br>

     We had to see that certificate belonged to the user who authenticated it....

   <br><br>  

  2) CRL retriever

 <br><br>

     1) retrieves crl from ldap servers
<br><br>
      2) installs in apache...der/pem  format..
<br><br>
     3) if crl expires , send email ...creates soft link
<br><br>
     4) removes old crl
<br><br>
 

  3) Reverse Proxies..
<br><br>
      The idea of using reverse proxy was to make our backend server called sexi ( more secure )...SeXI was put in the greenzone..
<br><br>
      Reverse does ..
<br><br>
           1) url filtering based on proxypass directive
<br><br>
           2) hides the back-end server ( so that user cannot do any hacking )
<br><br>
                        

 

Had to make the changes to IIS ISAPI plugin also...
<br><br>
 

===============================================================================

 

 

Large cookie issue:

 <br><br>

   Application team complained that they were not able to read their cookies via javascript...if they used our service...
<br><br>
   If you make the cookie httponly , probem gets solved...but leads to problem to applications using applets...Applet is embedded in web page....jvm..does not send http only cookie
<br><br>
 

   Cumulative length of cookies from particular exceed certain
<br><br>
   Server limit..( would not
<br><br>
   Browser limit ( single cookie cannot exceed certain limit )
<br><br>
 

  Created an application...very useful for the management...they could see for themselves..and talk to the application team..
<br><br>
    persistent/httponly..etc...
<br><br>
 

===========================================================================

 <br><br>

Security hole:
<br><br>
   HTTP_Groups header could be spoofed and user can get access even if you are not
<br><br>
  Behaviour also varies whether it is asp or aspx page..
<br><br>

<b style="color:red"> Inframon</b> <br>
Prior to inframon, monitoring was adhoc...

There were plethora of teeny weeny scripts...server names and monitoring details were hard coded in the files..so we were not even sure what was being monitored...what are the threshold values..

 

GSD team mere monitoring some applications globally...(sydney,stamford,tokyo,london)....the health of the servers with respect to application was important..

 

Solution was adopted by other teams...all they needed to do was set up their own database of servers to be monitored...

 

 

script would read config file ( details like sybase server details , socket server port etc..)

main script access the sybase database..gets the db handle...

get the allchanells logger handle..

 

process ..socket connection from where it is supposed to

then spawns process...(forks)

 

process monitor...installs sig child handler..

timeout using eval..

in each iteration , sends I am alive message...

 

Major advantage...by seeing the database you can see what is being monitored..you can change the threshold values...

No  maintenencae overhead...script could be customised to work in a different environment

<b style="color:red"> Restful</b> <br>

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture or an approach to building APIs on top of the web, which means on top of HTTP.
A RESTful API has 3 states
<ul>
<li>stateless like HTTP</li>
<li>supports common HTTP verbs like GET POST PUT DELETE</li>
<li>Returns data in form of JSON or XML format</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p id='stateless'>
<b style="color:red"> What is stateless protocol</b> <br>
HTTP is stateless protocol. This means each request response pair is completely independent of the previous one.
There is no stored memory of past interactions.
</p>

<hr>


<p id='http'>
<b style="color:red"> What is http protocol</b> <br>
HTTP is stateless protocol. It is a request response protocol between 2 computers that have an existing TCP connection.
The computer making the request is the client while the computer responding to it is the server.

<p id='endpoint'>
<b style="color:red"> What is an endpoint</b> <br>
A website consists of web pages with HTML, CSS, images, JavaScript, and more. But a web API has endpoints instead which are URLs with a list of available actions (HTTP verbs) that expose data (typically in JSON, which is the most common data format these days and the default for Django REST Framework).

<p id='microservice'>
<b style="color:red"> What is microservice</b> <br>
 A microservice, in short, is a service that lives in a
service-oriented architecture and is easy to reason about. These are
loosely coupled, lightweight components which have a well defined
interface, a single-purpose and are easy to create and dispose of. Due to
the fine-grained nature, more people can work on them in parallel and
ownership of features becomes a cleaner problem to solve for the
organization.
</p>

<hr>
<p id='downsides'>
<b style="color:red"> What are downsides of microservice</b> <br>
 The systems were too
distributed and dependencies became a burden instead of enablers.
Engineers needed speed and not a system where they needed to bump
versions every single component when they updated another one.
Maintaining the interface definitions became a nightmare after a while as
it was difficult to understand cross-dependencies and versioning among
the components. Engineers were looking for customized and unregulated
shortcuts more than they were engaged in the current working methods.

<p id='monolithic'>
<b style="color:red"> What is monolithic </b> <br>
 As we’ve learned, monoliths are codebases that grew too big and too
difficult to reason about by a single developer or even a team of
developers, their complexity has reached a point where changing even
just a couple of lines of code can have unintended and unknown
consequences in other parts.
when you’re working
on a monolithic application you’re almost encouraged to design the
architecture of your code and your data in a monolithic way. Designing
interfaces around your modules becomes a chore and just overhead, so
you just import the line that you need. Adding a new database for
subscription information takes way too much time and would just
introduce more complexity, so you create the models in the same
database as your user and product information resides. If you’re working
on a monolith, all layers of your code and architecture will be monolithic.
Naturally, strict coding guidelines, architecture principles and a
challenging engineering culture can build and maintain a monolith with
clear internal interface boundaries that can later be broken down into
microservices with more ease.

<p id='serviceoriented'>
<b style="color:red"> What is Service Oriented Architecture </b> <br>
This style of architecture design
supports services more than anything. A service,
needs to serve some sort of bus.iness need and needs to be modeled
around real world requirements. Services need to be self contained and
have a clean interface with which they can be communicated with. They
are deployed and developed independently and represent a unit of
functionality on an abstract level. The architecture also involves the
communication protocols used between these services.

<b style="color:red"> What is Docker? </b> <br>
Docker is a software platform for building applications based on containers — small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use of the operating system kernel but otherwise run in isolation from one another. .

</p>
<hr>

<p id='dockervscontainer'>
<b style="color:red"> Difference between Docker and container</b> <br>
One of the goals of modern software development is to keep applications on the same host or cluster isolated from one another so they don’t unduly interfere with each other’s operation or maintenance. This can be difficult, thanks to the packages, libraries, and other software components required for them to run. One solution to this problem has been virtual machines, which keep applications on the same hardware entirely separate, and reduce conflicts among software components and competition for hardware resources to a minimum. But virtual machines are bulky—each requires its own OS, so is typically gigabytes in size—and difficult to maintain and upgrade.

Containers, by contrast, isolate applications’ execution environments from one another, but share the underlying OS kernel. They’re typically measured in megabytes, use far fewer resources than VMs, and start up almost immediately.

<b style="color:red"> tell us more about docker </b> <br>

<ul>
<li>Docker</li>
Docker is an open source project that makes it easy to create containers and container-based apps. Originally built for Linux, Docker now runs on Windows and MacOS as well. To understand how Docker works, let’s take a look at some of the components you would use to create Docker-containerized applications.
<li>DockerFile</li>

Each Docker container starts with a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text file written in an easy-to-understand syntax that includes the instructions to build a Docker image (more on that in a moment). A Dockerfile specifies the operating system that will underlie the container, along with the languages, environmental variables, file locations, network ports, and other components it needs—and, of course, what the container will actually be doing once we run it.

Paige Niedringhaus over at ITNext has a good breakdown of the syntax of a Dockerfile.
<li>Docker image</li>

Once you have your Dockerfile written, you invoke the Docker build utility to create an image based on that Dockerfile. Whereas the Dockerfile is the set of instructions that tells build how to make the image, a Docker image is a portable file containing the specifications for which software components the container will run and how. Because a Dockerfile will probably include instructions about grabbing some software packages from online repositories, you should take care to explicitly specify the proper versions, or else your Dockerfile might produce inconsistent images depending on when it’s invoked. But once an image is created, it’s static. Codefresh offers a look at how to build an image in more detail.
<li>Docker run</li>

Docker’s run utility is the command that actually launches a container. Each container is an instance of an image. Containers are designed to be transient and temporary, but they can be stopped and restarted, which launches the container into the same state as when it was stopped. Further, multiple container instances of the same image can be run simultaneously (as long as each container has a unique name)
