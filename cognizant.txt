    It is home office project that deals with immigrations/visas process. At the end
    of the day, there are entitites like person,identity,address etc
    which flow through their system. At the moment everything is in java though some
    repositories had been created for porting stuff to python
    The project was supposed to be porting java apis to python with view making 
    changes to existing models and deploying on aws using lambda functions etc.
    But the project has gone on back burner. I did some work, working on few models,
    creating data generators for them and creating web apis or so called the reader 
    service.

    But now I am being asked to do java work which is not something I had planned or
    interested in.


    Excuse me if my eyes are bit droopy and my voice bit nasal, as I am quite sick 
    today, likely suffering from covid. I came very close to securing role with 
    jpmorgan, reached the 3rd round
    but did not work out in the end. I had taken the online programming test as well
    for that and felt bit bad and sad when it 
    But did not want to reschedule the interview
